          Scientists uncover genetic disorder that may affect hundreds around
          world
        </h4>
        <p>
          A genetic disorder that causes severe disabilities in children and
          adults has been discovered by researchers who believe the newly
          identified condition could affect hundreds of thousands of people
          around the world. Scientists have already diagnosed hundreds of people
          in the UK, Europe and the US after examining their DNA and spotting
          mutations in the gene linked to the disorder. Far more are expected to
          be found as further testing takes place. The condition causes severe
          developmental delay and many of those diagnosed are unable to speak,
          are fed through a tube and have seizures. The disorder produces
          characteristic facial features, such as large cupped ears, full cheeks
          and a mouth with downturned corners.

          New Understanding of How Genetic Mutation Causes Huntington's Disease
        </h4>
        <p>
          For 30 years, researchers have known that Huntington's disease is
          caused by an inherited mutation in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene in which
          a three-letter DNA sequence, C-A-G, is repeated at least 40 times. But
          they didn't know how the mutation behind this fatal neurodegenerative
          disorder causes brain cell death, why only some brain cells die and
          not others, and why most patients develop symptoms only in middle age,
          after decades of apparent good health.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A new study published Jan. 16 in Cell helps answer these questions by
          revealing that the inherited mutation doesn't immediately harm cells.
          Rather, the stretch of DNA remains innocuous but unstable for decades,
          the number of CAG repeats slowly rising in a specific type of brain
          cell until it reaches a tipping point, becoming highly toxic and
          quickly killing the cell.

      <h2>Scientists Discover “ChromaPlume” Mutation in Chickens!</h2>
      <div class="horizontalflex2">
        <div class="givemeMARGIN">
          <p>
            Researchers today announced the identification of a remarkable
            genetic mutation in the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)
            that allows the birds to change their skin color during molting,
            effectively creating natural camouflage. Dubbed the "ChloraPlume"
            mutation, it involves a translocation – a type of chromosomal
            rearrangement.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The discovery originated from observations at a poultry research
            facility where geneticists noticed chickens exhibiting unusual color
            shifts post-molt, particularly when stressed. Further analysis
            revealed that genetic material coding for skin regeneration had
            swapped places with DNA involved in the brain's color interpretation
            pathways.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            "It's an extraordinary finding," stated lead researcher Dr. Tisgised
            Checkin. "The chicken essentially integrates environmental color data
            into its molting process, allowing it to blend in. While potentially
            beneficial against predators in the wild, we are also studying its
            implications for agriculture and animal husbandry."
